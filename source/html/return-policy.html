                Cancellation of Services
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-5">
                You can cancel your subscription or service with us at any time by contacting our customer support team
                at info@zubizi.com. Once your cancellation is processed, all associated data and content will be deleted
                permanently from our systems. Please ensure that you have backed up all necessary information before
                canceling, as this process is irreversible.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
                If you cancel your subscription in the middle of a billing cycle, you will be billed a final invoice to
                cover services up to the cancellation date. After payment of this invoice, no further charges will be
                made.
