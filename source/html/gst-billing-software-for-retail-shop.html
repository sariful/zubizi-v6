                satisfaction, and compliance with government regulations. Our GST Billing Software offers more than just

                    <p>
                        Keeping track of GST calculations manually can be tricky and error-prone. The Zubizi GST
                        Billing Software ensures full GST compliance by automatically calculating taxes on every
                        transaction and generating detailed GST reports. These reports can be easily exported and
                        submitted to the relevant tax authorities, saving you time and reducing the risk of
                        penalties.

                    <p>
                        Create professional GST-compliant invoices within seconds. The software offers customizable
                        invoice templates that can include your shop's branding, item details, tax calculations, and
                        terms of service. Whether you deal with regular customers or wholesale clients, our software
                        supports multiple pricing models and discount options.

                        One of the standout features of Zubizi's GST Billing Software is its integrated inventory
                        management system. This feature ensures that you are always aware of stock levels, reorder
                        points, and item-wise sales performance. Real-time updates help you avoid stock-outs and
                        overstocking, which can lead to missed sales or unnecessary storage costs.

                        The software automatically adjusts stock levels after each sale, and you can set alerts for low
                        inventory to ensure timely reordering.

                    <h3 class="font-bold mb-3 text-lg">Sales and Purchase Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our software doesn't just handle outgoing transactions but also tracks your purchases from
                        suppliers. This ensures accurate records of incoming stock and allows for better decision-making

                            Not every employee needs access to every feature of your retail software. Our GST Billing
                            Software includes role-based access control, meaning you can limit what certain employees
                            can view or edit. Cashiers, managers, and owners can have distinct permissions based on
                            their roles, enhancing both security and operational efficiency.

                            forms based on your transactions and exports into excel, PDF and JSON file.
