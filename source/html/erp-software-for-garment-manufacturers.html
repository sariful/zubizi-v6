                            Managing the garment manufacturing process involves coordinating various production stages
                            efficiently, ensuring that each batch moves smoothly from one step to the next. Our ERP
                            software offers comprehensive tools to help you <strong>track, organize, and
                                control</strong> these stages seamlessly, resulting in better productivity and
                            streamlined operations.

                            <strong>Batch and Lot Creation:</strong> At the core of process management is the ability to
                            create production batches. With our ERP software, you can quickly set up production lots,
                            specifying the product, required quantity, and materials needed. This initial step
                            centralizes all data, making it easy to manage and track the entire production flow

                                <strong>Optimize Resource Allocation:</strong> Ensure the right materials and labor are
                                allocated efficiently from the beginning.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Improve Planning:</strong> Stay on top of deadlines by setting production

                            multiple stagesâ€”cutting, stitching, embroidery, printing, ironing, packaging, etc. Our ERP
                            system tracks each stage, allowing you to monitor progress in real-time. This level of

                                efficiency.

                            finished goods are automatically entered into stock. This direct update ensures that your
                            inventory always reflects the latest production output. From there, you can easily generate
                            invoices linked to the finished products, complete with automatic GST calculations for
                            accurate billing. This integration eliminates manual entry, ensuring a smooth transition
                            from production to sales.

                            Effective <strong>inventory management</strong> is vital for garment manufacturers who need
                            to balance raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished products across multiple
                            locations. Our ERP software streamlines this process by providing <strong>real-time
                                visibility</strong> into your entire inventory, ensuring you have the right materials at
                            the right time, without overstocking or running into shortages.

                            which allows you to track materials and products throughout the supply chain with ease. Each
                            item can be assigned a unique barcode, enabling faster stock entries, tracking, and
                            retrieval. This ensures precise data on stock levels and streamlines the movement of
                            materials and products across different stages of production.
